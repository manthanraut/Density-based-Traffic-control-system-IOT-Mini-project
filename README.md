# Density-based-Traffic-control-system-IOT-Mini-project
This is a IOT wireless network based project where sensors form a network and provide certain data using which information is generated and accordingly actions are taken.

<< ABSTRACT >>
Traffic congestion nowadays has become a chronic issue in the Metropolitan cities due to which it takes more time to travel than the same distance travelled during the off-peak hours. This decreases the productivity of an individual by instances such as delayed delivery of services, unnecessary fuel consumption, air and noise pollution, delay in the case of emergency. The traffic congestion has become a predominant problem due to the rapid increase in the demand of vehicles. This project aims to develop a convenient traffic system that allows a smooth movement of cars which will help build a smarter city. The traffic system currently implemented in many areas is not based on the density of traffic and every road is allotted a preset time. This results in traffic congestion due to large red-light delays and timings allotted for roads in a city that should vary during peak on-off hours, but in reality, don’t. These traditional systems are not adaptable and fail to support traffic during an unexpected situation or during an accident, and this makes them inefficient. In order to calculate the density of traffic various sensors can be used, each having their merits and demerits. In our proposed system Ultrasonic Sensors are used that works on a Raspberry Pi platform and calculates the vehicle density on a lane and dynamically allots time for different levels of traffic. This in turn allows better signal control and effective management of traffic thereby reducing the probability of a collision. By using Internet of Things (IOT) real time data from the system can be collected, stored and managed.
